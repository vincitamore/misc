# Comprehensive Guide to Obtaining a Federal Firearms License (FFL) and Export Licensing for Semiautomatic Rifles and Pistols

This guide provides a self-contained overview of the process for obtaining a Federal Firearms License (FFL) in the United States, focusing on Type 01 for dealers, and the subsequent steps for engaging in export activities, particularly for semiautomatic rifles and pistols. Information is based on U.S. federal regulations as of July 2025, administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for FFLs, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) for most commercial firearms exports under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for items under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) if applicable. Always consult official sources or legal experts for your specific situation, as regulations can change.

## Section 1: Obtaining a Federal Firearms License (FFL)

An FFL is required to engage in the business of dealing, manufacturing, or importing firearms. Type 01 allows dealers to buy, sell, and gunsmith firearms (other than destructive devices) domestically and enables certain export activities but limits imports.

### Eligibility Requirements
To qualify for an FFL:
- You must intend to operate a firearms business (except for Type 03 collectors).
- You cannot be prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law (e.g., no felony convictions, domestic violence restraining orders, or other disqualifiers).
- All "Responsible Persons" (RPs)—including owners, partners, corporate officers, shareholders, board members, or anyone with authority over firearms operations—must undergo background checks.
- Your business premises must comply with federal, state, and local laws, including zoning ordinances.
- Falsifying information or prior willful violations of the Gun Control Act may lead to denial.
- You must be at least 21 years old (for most types) and a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

Background checks are conducted electronically, and the process typically takes about 60 days from receipt of a complete application [ATF Apply for License](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/apply-license).

### FFL Types, Descriptions, and Fees
FFL types vary based on activities. Fees are for a 3-year term and non-refundable. Initial fees are paid with the application; renewals cost half the initial fee for most types (e.g., Type 01 renewal is $90). Pay by check, money order, or credit card (no cash) [ATF FFL Fees](https://rocketffl.com/ffl-cost/).

| Type | Description | Initial Fee | Renewal Fee |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 01 | Dealer in Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices (e.g., retail sales, gunsmithing; allows domestic dealing and exporting but not commercial importing) | $200 | $90 |
| 02 | Pawnbroker in Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices | $200 | $90 |
| 03 | Collector of Curios and Relics (personal collection only; no business intent required) | $30 | $30 |
| 06 | Manufacturer of Ammunition for Firearms Other Than Ammunition for Destructive Devices or Armor-Piercing Ammunition | $30 | $30 |
| 07 | Manufacturer of Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices (includes manufacturing and dealing) | $150 | $150 |
| 08 | Importer of Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices (for commercial imports) | $150 | $150 |
| 09 | Dealer in Destructive Devices | $3,000 | $3,000 |
| 10 | Manufacturer of Destructive Devices | $3,000 | $3,000 |
| 11 | Importer of Destructive Devices | $3,000 | $3,000 |

## Section 2: Engaging in International Trade with a Type 01 FFL

A Type 01 FFL primarily supports domestic activities but has limitations and capabilities for international trade.

### Importing Firearms
- Type 01 **cannot** conduct commercial imports for resale. This requires a Type 08 or 11 FFL.
- Limited non-commercial imports allowed (e.g., personal use, repairs, or as an agent for a customer, but not for business inventory).

### Exporting Firearms
- Type 01 **can** export firearms as part of business activities, provided you obtain required export licenses.
- For semiautomatic rifles and pistols (mainly civilian/commercial use), most fall under BIS jurisdiction since the 2020 export control reforms transferred them from ITAR to EAR [BIS Revision of Firearms License Requirements](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/30/2024-08813/revision-of-firearms-license-requirements). No major changes to this jurisdiction as of 2025.
- If items are military-grade or remain on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) Category I (e.g., certain automatic firearms, suppressors), they fall under DDTC/ITAR.
- Additional ATF approval (e.g., Form 9 for NFA items) and compliance with destination country laws required.
- Submit a Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ) request via [DDTC Form DS-4076](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=%2520249f7c0adb6cf7007ede365e7c9619fd) if jurisdiction is unclear.

## Section 3: Obtaining Export Licenses

### Determining Jurisdiction
- Most semiautomatic rifles (ECCN 0A501.a) and pistols (0A501.b) are under BIS/EAR for commercial exports [BIS Firearms FAQs](https://www.bis.gov/media/documents/april-2024-firearms-rule-frequently-asked-questions-april-30-2024.pdf).
- Check the Commerce Control List (CCL) and USML. If unclear, file a CJ request with DDTC.

### BIS Export License Process (EAR – Most Applicable for Semiautomatic Firearms)
No registration fee required. Applications via SNAP-R; process takes 30-45 days. No application fees for firearm licenses.

1. **Classify Items and Check Requirements**: Use CCL to confirm ECCN (e.g., 0A501). Review Commerce Country Chart for license needs based on destination/end-use.
2. **Check Exceptions**: Limited for firearms (e.g., BAG for personal, TMP for temporary); most commercial exports need a license.
3. **Prepare Documents**: Item details (models, calibers, serial numbers), end-user statements, import certificates from destination.
4. **Register for SNAP-R**: Create account at [SNAP-R Portal](https://snapr.bis.gov/).
5. **Submit Application**: Use Form BIS-748P electronically. Specify controls (e.g., FC for Firearms Convention).
