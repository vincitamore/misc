# Translation Notes: Kierkegaard's "Mængden er Usandheden"

## Overview

This document records the translation decisions made in rendering Søren Kierkegaard's *Mængden er Usandheden* (The Crowd is Untruth) from the Danish original into modern English. The translation was completed in January 2026 from the full Danish source text, replacing an earlier version that relied primarily on Charles K. Bellinger's public domain translation.

## Key Terminological Decisions

### 1. Mængden — "The Crowd"

The Danish *Mængde* / *Mængden* (definite form) is consistently rendered as "crowd" rather than alternatives like "mass," "multitude," or "mob."

**Rationale:**
- "Crowd" captures the sense of people gathered together without implying the political overtones of "mass" (as in "mass movement")
- Kierkegaard explicitly distinguishes his use from class-based meanings—he is *not* contrasting "the crowd" with "the nobles" (*de Fornemme*)
- "Crowd" preserves the concrete, physical sense: people who have *come together*
- The definite article in Danish (*Mængden*) is preserved as "the crowd" to maintain the conceptual specificity

### 2. Usandheden — "Untruth"

Rendered straightforwardly as "untruth" rather than "falsehood," "lie," or "error."

**Rationale:**
- *Usandhed* is the direct negation of *Sandhed* (truth)—it is un-truth, the absence or negation of truth
- "Falsehood" implies deliberate deception; "lie" even more so
- "Error" implies mere mistake
- Kierkegaard's point is ontological/existential: the crowd's very mode of being excludes truth. "Untruth" captures this metaphysical claim
- The stark simplicity of "The Crowd is Untruth" has aphoristic power

### 3. Hiin Enkelte — "That Single Individual"

The dedication's addressee, *hiin Enkelte*, is rendered as "that single individual."

**Rationale:**
- *Hiin* is an archaic Danish demonstrative (that one, yonder) with a distancing, almost reverential quality
- *Enkelte* means "single" or "individual"
- "That single individual" preserves both the demonstrative pointing and the emphasis on singularity
- This is Kierkegaard's signature phrase—it must sound distinctive
- Alternative: "that solitary one" (captures *hiin* but loses *Enkelte*'s connection to individuality)

### 4. Kun Een naaer Maalet — "Only one reaches the goal"

This crucial phrase (from 1 Corinthians 9:24) was changed from "receives the prize" to "reaches the goal."

**Rationale:**
- The Danish *naaer Maalet* literally means "reaches/attains the goal" (*Maal* = goal, aim, target)
- The Greek original (βραβεῖον) does mean "prize," but Kierkegaard's Danish emphasizes the *striving* toward a goal
- "Reaches the goal" better captures the existential dimension: life as a striving, not a competition for rewards
- "Prize" implies external reward; "goal" implies telos, fulfillment, becoming what one ought to be
- This connects to Kierkegaard's broader philosophy of existence as task

### 5. Instantsen — "The final authority"

Bellinger's "court of last resort" was replaced with "the final authority" or "the ultimate arbiter."

**Rationale:**
- *Instants* (from Latin *instantia*) means an authoritative body that decides, a court of appeal
- "Court of last resort" is technically accurate but sounds legalistic and clunky in English prose
- "Final authority" captures the meaning more naturally: the crowd claims to be the ultimate judge of truth
- Variation: "ultimate arbiter" used occasionally for rhetorical variety

### 6. Sandheds-Vidne — "Witness for the truth"

Rendered as "witness for the truth" rather than "witness to the truth."

**Rationale:**
- *Vidne* = witness; *Sandheds-Vidne* = truth-witness
- "Witness for" implies advocacy, testimony on behalf of truth
- "Witness to" implies merely observing
- Kierkegaard means the former: one who testifies, who stakes their life on truth
- The phrase connects to martyrdom (*martyr* = witness in Greek)

### 7. Mellembestemmelse — "Mediating presence"

This philosophical term was rendered as "mediating presence" rather than "middle term."

**Rationale:**
- *Mellembestemmelse* literally means "middle-determination" or "intermediate term"
- In context, Kierkegaard means God as the necessary mediator between truth-giver and truth-receiver
- "Middle term" sounds too logical/syllogistic
- "Mediating presence" captures the personal, relational nature of God's role
- Preserves the philosophical precision while sounding more natural

### 8. Angerløshed — "Without conscience" / "Unaccountable"

This term is rendered variously as "without conscience," "unrepentant," or "unaccountable" depending on context.

**Rationale:**
- *Anger* = remorse, repentance; *-løshed* = -lessness
- Literally: "remorselessness" or "unrepentance"
- The core meaning is: no one feels personally responsible
- "Without conscience" used when describing how crowds eliminate individual moral sense
- "Unaccountable" used when describing anonymous authorship (no one to hold responsible)

## Stylistic Decisions

### Sentence Structure and Rhythm

Kierkegaard's Danish prose has a distinctive rhythm: long, winding sentences punctuated by short, emphatic declarations. The translation preserves this pattern.

**Example — Climactic brevity:**
> Danish: "dette er Sandheden"
> Translation: "This is the truth."

These short declarations function as rhetorical punctuation after extended arguments. They are set in italics to mark their emphatic function.

**Example — Building intensity:**
> Danish: "altsaa: Ingen. Ingen!"
> Translation: "therefore: *No One*. No One!"

The repetition and exclamation are preserved exactly. The italics on the first instance create a pause before the cry of the second.

### Anaphora and Parallelism

Kierkegaard uses anaphoric structures (repeated sentence openings) for rhetorical effect. These are carefully preserved:

> "This means: everyone can be that one..."
> "This means: everyone should deal cautiously..."
> "This means: the human being is akin to the divine..."

The triple repetition builds the argument while creating incantatory emphasis.

### The Dash

Danish uses the em-dash extensively for parenthetical insertions, dramatic pauses, and syntactic pivots. The translation preserves this characteristic:

> "Who you are, I do not know. Where you are, I do not know. What your name is, I do not know. Yet you are my hope, my joy, my pride—in my unknowing, my honour."

The dash before "in my unknowing" creates the turn: what might seem like ignorance becomes the very ground of honour.

### Maintaining Kierkegaard's Voice

Several distinctive features of Kierkegaard's rhetorical voice were preserved:

1. **Direct address:** "You who say this, ask yourself..."
2. **Self-implication:** "every human being, you and I, should be one"
3. **Rhetorical questions:** "Do you dare claim that..."
4. **Exclamatory interjections:** "What untruth!" / "What frightening untruth!"
5. **The signature refrain:** "The crowd is untruth" repeated throughout as structural punctuation

## Philosophical Concepts

### The Single Individual vs. The Specimen

Kierkegaard contrasts two views of human existence:

| Danish | Translation | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| *Individ* | individual | a unique, irreplaceable person |
| *Exemplar* | specimen | a replaceable instance of a type |

The crowd reduces individuals to specimens—interchangeable units of a species. True humanity is individuality before God.

### The Eternal vs. The Temporal

| Danish | Translation | Domain |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| *det Evige* | the eternal | God, truth, the soul's relation to the divine |
| *det Timelige* | the temporal | worldly affairs, politics, earthly goals |

Kierkegaard insists that crowd-validity applies to temporal matters but becomes untruth when applied to eternal matters.

### Truth as Relation

A key philosophical point: truth is not a proposition but a *relation*. Truth requires:
- A single individual as communicator
- A single individual as receiver
- God as mediating presence

This triadic structure excludes crowds by definition—you cannot have a personal, God-mediated relation with an abstraction.

## Departures from Bellinger

| Passage | Bellinger | New Translation | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 Cor 9:24 | "receives the prize" | "reaches the goal" | Closer to Danish; emphasizes striving over competition |
| *Instantsen* | "court of last resort" | "final authority" | More natural English; less legalistic |
| *i Stilhed* | "in private" | "in stillness" | Captures contemplative, interior quality |
| *hans Svælg* | "his gullet" | "his maw" | More contemptuous; matches Kierkegaard's tone |
| Opening note | Endnote | Integrated preface | Matches Danish text structure |

## Difficult Passages

### "Does not produce change by being more than change"

> Danish: "som ikke gjør Fordring paa at være mere og altsaa gjør Intet mindre end Fordring, men hellere Indrømmelse"

This dense passage was rendered:
> "a disposition of soul and mind that does not claim to produce change by being *more* than change, and therefore produces nothing less than change: it is rather an admission"

**Interpretation:** Kierkegaard is saying his view doesn't claim to be a grand system (more than mere change/transformation). By not claiming more, it doesn't fall short of its claims. It is an admission (of weakness, limitation) rather than a proclamation of power.

### "Caius Marius" Example

Kierkegaard references an episode from Roman history: Gaius Marius, the general, was so imposing that a soldier sent to kill him could not do it when facing him alone. The example illustrates how individuals have courage (or cowardice) that crowds obscure.

The name is kept in its Latinate form (*Caius Marius*) rather than modernized to *Gaius Marius*, matching Kierkegaard's usage and the 19th-century convention.

### "The dance hall"

> Danish: "en Dandsebod"

A *Dandsebod* was a disreputable public dance hall—a place of moral looseness. The translation keeps "dance hall" (rather than "nightclub" or similar modern equivalent) to preserve the historical flavor while remaining comprehensible.

## Notes on the Danish Text

### Orthography

The source text uses 19th-century Danish orthography:
- *aa* for modern *å* (e.g., *Maal* → modern *Mål*)
- *ee* occasionally for modern *e* (e.g., *Een* → *én*)
- Different capitalization conventions (nouns capitalized as in German)

These features required careful reading but did not affect translation.

### Footnotes

The Danish original includes extensive footnotes marked with asterisks. In the translation, the key clarificatory points from these notes are woven into the main text where possible, or mentioned in the prefatory note. The footnotes primarily clarify:

1. That "crowd" is a formal/conceptual term, not a class designation
2. That crowd-validity is acceptable in temporal/political matters
3. That preaching to multitudes is not the same as treating them as truth's arbiter

### The "Anmærkning" (Note)

The closing "Anm." (Anmærkning = Note) by Kierkegaard refers to the "Corsair affair"—when he deliberately provoked a satirical magazine's attacks on him in 1846. This "literary vulgarity" left him isolated but confirmed his views on crowds and public opinion. The translation preserves this note as "A Note by the Author."
